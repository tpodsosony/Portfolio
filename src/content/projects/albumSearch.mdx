This was a project created in React using LastFM's public API to search for artists and their respective albums. As my first array into React last year, it was a fairly fun challenge.
React was relatively smooth to learn, what I had issues with is figuring out how to fully utilize the API. 

Since it has been a while since this project was done, I do not have a lot to say about it, and it is relatively small. I'll leave a link for people to enjoy of the website running on 
[CodeSandbox](https://mmrlkn.csb.app/)!
